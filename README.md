# js-simple-todo-list
 This repository contains a simple to-do list project I'm using to practice my JavaScript skills. The project includes basic functionalities such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. It's designed as a hands-on way to get more comfortable with JavaScript coding and web application development.
